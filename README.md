# Parkinson-Disease-Detection

## What is Parkinson's Disease?

It is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects predominately dopamine-producing (“dopaminergic”) neurons in a specific area of the brain.
It affects the Central Nervous System o four brain which leads to balance problems, continuosly rolling something (tremor).

## How we detect using the Algorithms.

So, inorder to detect the Parkinson's Disease early we have used the machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost, Random Forest.

In our training and testing the best fitted model we have find with best accuracy is XGBoost which has accuracy of 94%.

So XGBoost is a classifier, where it implements the gradient boosting decision tree algorithm.It is called gradient boosting because it uses a gradient descent algorithm to minimize the loss when adding new models. This approach supports both regression and classification predictive modeling problems.

If the disease is detected early, precautionary measures can be taken and treatement can be started for the same.
